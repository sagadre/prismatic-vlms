### ðŸš¨ Note for TRI Collaborators

**Internal development repository for [https://github.com/TRI-ML/prismatic-vlms](https://github.com/TRI-ML/prismatic-vlms).**

To facilitate a clean workflow with open-source/public code, this internal repository adopts the following structure:

- **[Default]** `vlm-core` - Treat this as the `main` branch for developing new VLM-related changes; always PR to this
  branch in lieu of `main`.
- `vla-core` - This is the central branch for developing on vision-language-action models; this is synced with external
  collaborators. If working on the OpenVLA project, always PR to this branch!
- `main` - Treat this as a **locked branch**; it tracks the latest stable code in the open-source repository.

**Important:** Assume that all commits/features developed for `vlm-core` will be eventually merged into the upstream
open-source Prismatic VLMs repository (so keep things clean and informative). If working on a separate feature (e.g.,
for a different project/internal hacking), operate off a separate branch.

#### [TRI] Setup Instructions

Fork this repository to your personal TRI account (e.g., `siddk-tri/prismatic-dev`). This will automatically set
`vlm-core` as your main working branch. Set up your remotes to track this repository `TRI-ML/prismatic-dev`:

```bash
# This should indicate that `origin` is set to your local fork (e.g., `siddk-tri/prismatic-dev.git`)
git remote -v

# Add `TRI-ML/prismatic-dev.git` as a separate remote (conventionally `upstream`; I prefer `tri-origin`)
git remote add tri-origin https://github.com/TRI-ML/prismatic-dev.git

# [Periodically] Sync any upstream changes to your local branch
git pull tri-origin vlm-core
```

Cut a new (local) feature branch for anything you want to add to the Prismatic VLM codebase:

```bash
# Create a new (local) feature branch after syncing `vlm-core`
git switch -c <feature-branch-name>

# Do work... commit frequently...
git add <changed files>
git commit -m "<informative and clean commit message>"

# Push to *local* fork (`origin`)
git push -u origin <feature-branch-name>
```

When ready, initiate PR to `TRI-ML/prismatic-dev@vlm-core`. The maintainers (Sidd/Suraj/Ashwin) will review and provide
instructions for merging/pushing to the open-source repository (if applicable).

[**Installation**](#installation) | [**Usage**](#usage) | [**Pretrained Models**](#pretrained-models) | [**Training VLMs**](#training-vlms)

A flexible and efficient codebase for training visually-conditioned language-models (VLMs):

- **Different Visual Representations**. We natively support backbones such as [CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020),
  [SigLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15343), [DINOv2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07193) â€“ and even fusions of different backbones.
  Adding new backbones is easy via [TIMM](https://huggingface.co/timm).
- **Base and Instruct-Tuned Language Models**. We support arbitrary instances of `AutoModelForCausalLM` including both
  base and instruct-tuned models (with built-in prompt handling) via [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).
  If your favorite LM isn't already supported, feel free to submit a PR!
- **Easy Scaling**. Powered by PyTorch FSDP and Flash-Attention, we can quickly and efficiently train models from 1B -
  34B parameters, on different, easily configurable dataset mixtures.

If you're interested in rigorously evaluating existing VLMs, check our [evaluation codebase](https://github.com/TRI-ML/vlm-evaluation)
that bundles together 11 different battle-tested vision-and-language benchmarks through a clean, automated test harness.

## Installation

This repository was built using Python 3.10, but should be backwards compatible with any Python >= 3.8. We require
PyTorch 2.2.* -- installation instructions [can be found here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). The latest version of this repository (`v0.0.3`)
was developed and thoroughly tested with:
  - PyTorch 2.2.0, torchvision 0.17.0, transformers 4.40.1, tokenizers 0.19.1, timm 0.9.10, and flash-attn 2.5.5

**[5/21/24] Note**: Following reported regressions and breaking changes in later versions of `transformers`, `timm`, and
`tokenizers` we explicitly pin the above versions of the dependencies. We are working on implementing thorough tests, 
and plan on relaxing these constraints as soon as we can.

Once PyTorch has been properly installed, you can install this package locally via an editable installation:

```bash
cd prismatic-dev
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pre-commit install

# Training additionally requires Flash-Attention 2 (https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention)
pip install packaging ninja

# Verify Ninja --> should return exit code "0"
ninja --version; echo $?

# Install Flash Attention 2
#   =>> If you run into difficulty, try `pip cache remove flash_attn` first
pip install "flash-attn==2.5.5" --no-build-isolation
```

If you run into any problems during the installation process, please file a GitHub Issue.

## Usage

Once installed, loading and running inference with pretrained `prismatic` models is easy:

```python
import requests
import torch

from PIL import Image
from pathlib import Path

from prismatic import load

# For gated LMs like Llama-2, make sure to request official access, and generate an access token
hf_token = Path(".hf_token").read_text().strip()
device = torch.device("cuda") if torch.cuda.is_available() else torch.device("cpu")

# Load a pretrained VLM (either local path, or ID to auto-download from the HF Hub)
model_id = "prism-dinosiglip+7b"
vlm = load(model_id, hf_token=hf_token)
vlm.to(device, dtype=torch.bfloat16)

# Download an image and specify a prompt
image_url = "https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/beignets-task-guide.png"
image = Image.open(requests.get(image_url, stream=True).raw).convert("RGB")
user_prompt = "What is going on in this image?"

# Build prompt
prompt_builder = vlm.get_prompt_builder()
prompt_builder.add_turn(role="human", message=user_prompt)
prompt_text = prompt_builder.get_prompt()

# Generate!
generated_text = vlm.generate(
    image,
    prompt_text,
    do_sample=True,
    temperature=0.4,
    max_new_tokens=512,
    min_length=1,
)
```

For a complete terminal-based CLI for interacting with our VLMs, check out [scripts/generate.py](scripts/generate.py).

## Pretrained Models

We release **all 49** VLMs trained as part of our work, with a range of different visual representations, language
models, data, and scale. The exhaustive set of models (with structured descriptions) can be found in
[`prismatic/models/registry.py](prismatic/models/registry.py) - we will continue to update this registry as we train
additional models.

We also provide a top-level API for instantiating models from the names mentioned in the various Figures of our paper,
as well as for generally browsing our pretrained models by description:

```python
from prismatic import available_model_names, available_models, get_model_description
from pprint import pprint

# List all Pretrained VLMs (by HF Hub IDs)
pprint(available_models())

# List all Pretrained VLMs + Descriptions (by explicit labels / names from paper figures)
pprint(available_model_names())

# Print and return a targeted description of a model (by name or ID)
#   =>> See `prismatic/models/registry.py` for explicit schema
description = get_model_description("Prism-DINOSigLIP 13B (Controlled)")
```

Currently, our best performing models are the `Prism-DINOSigLIP` series, with especially strong performance on spatial
understanding and localization tasks.

**Explicit Notes on Model Licensing & Commercial Use**: While all code in this repository is released under an MIT
License, our pretrained models inherit restrictions from the _datasets_ and _underlying LMs_ we use for training.

**[Initial Release]** All released VLMs except `mistral-v0.1+7b`, `mistral-instruct-v0.1+7b`, and `phi-2+3b` are derived 
from Llama-2, and as such are subject to the [Llama Community License](https://ai.meta.com/llama/license/), which does permit commercial use. We 
additionally train on the LLaVa Instruct Tuning data, which is synthetically generated using OpenAI's GPT-4 
(subject to the [OpenAI Terms of Use](https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use)).

**[5/21/24]** We release two `mistral-*-v0.1*` models derived from
[Mistral v0.1](https://mistral.ai/news/announcing-mistral-7b/) which is subject to an Apache 2.0 License. We also 
release `phi-2+3b` derived from 
[Phi-2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/phi-2-the-surprising-power-of-small-language-models/) released
under an MIT License.

As we train new models, we will update this section of the README (and the LICENSE files associated with each model)
appropriately. If there are any questions, please file an Issue!

## Training VLMs

In addition to providing all pretrained VLMs trained in this work, we also provide full instructions and configurations
for _reproducing all results_ (down to controlling for the batch order of examples seen during training).

#### Pretraining Datasets
For the [LLaVa v1.5 Instruct Dataset](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/docs/Data.md) we use for all
of our models, we provide an automated download script in [`scripts/preprocess.py`](scripts/preprocess.py):

```bash
# Download the `llava-v1.5-instruct` (Instruct Tuning) Image and Language Data (includes extra post-processing)
python scripts/preprocess.py --dataset_id "llava-v1.5-instruct" --root_dir <PATH-TO-DATA-ROOT>

# (In case you also wish to download the explicit vision-language alignment data)
python scripts/preprocess.py --dataset_id "llava-laion-cc-sbu-558k" --root_dir <PATH-TO-DATA-ROOT>
```

As part of our work, we also train on mixtures of datasets including
[LVIS-Instruct-4V](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07574) and [LRV-Instruct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14565). We provide
instructions and scripts for downloading these datasets in [`scripts/additional-datasets`](scripts/additional-datasets).

We welcome any and all contributions and pull requests to add new datasets!

#### Model Configuration & Training Script

The entry point for training models is [`scripts/pretrain.py`](scripts/pretrain.py). We employ
[`draccus`](https://pypi.org/project/draccus/0.6/) to provide a modular, dataclass-based interface for specifying
model configurations; all 42 VLM configurations are in [`prismatic/conf/models.py`](prismatic/conf/models.py).

We use PyTorch Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) to distribute training across GPUs, though we also provide a simpler
Distributed Data Parallel training implementation (for smaller LM backbones, debugging). You can run a pretraining job
via `torchrun`.

As a compact example, here's how you would train a VLM derived from VicuÃ±a-v1.5 7B, using fused DINOv2 + SigLIP
representations, processing non-square images with a "letterbox padding" transform across 8 GPUs on a single-node:

```bash
# Run from the root of the repository
torchrun --standalone --nnodes 1 --nproc-per-node 8 scripts/pretrain.py \
  --model.type "one-stage+7b" \
  --model.model_id "<NAME OF NEW MODEL>" \
  --model.vision_backbone_id "dinosiglip-vit-so-384px" \
  --model.image_resize_strategy "letterbox" \
  --model.llm_backbone_id "vicuna-v15-7b"
```

Note that specifying `model.type` is important for identifying the _base configuration_ that you want to build on top of;
the full list of model types are available in our [config file](prismatic/conf/models.py), under the `model_id` key for
each dataclass.
